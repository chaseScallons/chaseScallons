**Research:**
<br>
I have compiled a comprehensive collection of what I belive to be the the necessary building blocks for any proposed "general intelligence" system. This collection is constantly evolving as my understanding of AI widens and deepens.

*Perception* – *Language* – *Reasoning* – *Knowledge* – *Learning* – *Control*

This collection is the result of a years long effort to learn as much as I can about artifiical Intelligence as a CS undergrad. I have a dense stack of written documents and diagrams for each aspect of intelligence that I will be publishing with code, as the code gets written. My hope is for these ideas to evolve into a "framework of frameworks" if you will; a framework endowed with intelligence. I am calling it the **ShiftGenesis** project.

That's probably not the best description, but I'm working on it. :)
