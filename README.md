I have compiled a distinct collection of what I belive to be the the necessary building blocks for any proposed "general intelligence" system. This collection is constantly evolving as my understanding of AI deepens.

– Perception
– Language
– Reasoning
– Knowledge
– Learning
– Control

This collection is the result of a years long effort to learn as much as I can about artifiical Intelligence as a CS undergrad. I have a dense collection of written documents for each aspect of intelligence that I will be publishing with code, as the code gets written. My hope is for these ideas to evlove into a "framework of frameworks" if you will; a framework endowed with intelligence. 

That's probably not the best description, but I'm working on it. :)
